NOTE: Participants with an abnormal CXR or CT scan (which may indicate pulmonary KS) should undergo screening evaluations to rule out an infectious  

"cause, per standard of care. If available, other diagnostic procedures such as bronchoscopy should be considered to confirm the presence or absence of pulmonary KS and/or an infectious agent. These procedures should be  "


"completed outside the study. These participants should be excluded if, in the opinion of the site investigator, use of bleomycin would be detrimental.  "
