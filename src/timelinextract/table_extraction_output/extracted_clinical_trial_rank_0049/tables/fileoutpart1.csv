Study title:  Study of the QOL evaluation of Trelagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus  
Protocol number: Trelagliptin-4002  
"Clinical study design:  This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, parallel-group comparison study to assess the reduction in treatment burden during the administration of a DPP-4 inhibitor (trelagliptin or a daily DPP-4 inhibitor) for 12 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes on diet and exercise therapy only.  Subjects who are determined to be eligible based on the results of eligibility assessment after informed consent has been obtained will be randomized to either the study drug (trelagliptin) group or the comparative drug (daily DPP-4 inhibitor) group. Randomization was stratified by the total score (<80% (score 139.4), ≥80% (score 139.4)*)) for total score of the “Diabetes Therapy-Related QOL (DTR-QOL) Questionnaire” and “HbA1c (<8.0%, ≥8.0%)” at the start of the screening period.  * A scale of 1 to 7 with 7 as the best was used for each QOL question item, and total score calculated by adding up scores of each question was expressed as a percentage of the maximum total score (i.e., the best score [203] = 100%; the worst score [29] = 0%.)
