Protocol Identifiers (IRB – internal)  ,IRB 115099 - HCI-18-GU-11  
IND number  ,Exempt  
Phase  ,Phase II  
Design  ,"This is an open label, randomized prospective study of ADT + Abiraterone vs. ADT + Docetaxel in men with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer.  "
Study Duration  ,"This study is expected to enroll for 24 months. Patients will be followed for 18 months or until disease progression, whichever occurs first. It will take approximately 3.5 years to complete the study.  "
Study Center(s)  ,"This will be a multi-institution trial conducted at the Huntsman Cancer Institute, at the University of Utah. Up to 7 additional centers may be opened.  "
Objectives  ,The primary objective of this study is to assess the difference in QOL from baseline to month 12 between ADT + Docetaxel vs ADT + Abiraterone.  
Number of Subjects  ,89 patients will be enrolled. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to each treatment arm.  
Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria  ,"- Male subject aged ≥ 18 years.   - Histologically diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the prostate by WHO.   - Radiographically confirmed metastatic disease prior to patient enrollment. Metastatic disease can be confirmed based on conventional imaging (CT, MRI, nuclear medicine bone scan) or molecular imaging (fluciclovine-PET/CT, PSMA-PET/CT, Choline-PET/CT etc).   - ECOG ≤ 2.   - Prior therapy with ADT or first generation anti-androgen receptor therapy (example: bicalutamide) is allowed.   - Prior abiraterone or docetaxel use for metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer is not allowed.    "
,- Completed any hormone therapy for localized prostate cancer and testosterone has recovered.   - Patients must not have a histologic diagnosis of small cell prostate cancer or pure squamous cell prostate cancer.    
"Study Product, Dose, Route, Regimen,  Duration of administration  ","All patients will be treated with ongoing standard of care ADT (surgical or medical castration, documented testosterone should be < 50 ng/dL while on study.)  Arm A: ADT + 75mg/m2 Docetaxel IV Q3weeks x 6 cycles.   Arm B: ADT + Abiraterone PO continuous until disease progression.  "
Statistical Methodology  ,Statistical analysis will be performed in collaboration with HCI biostatistical support and use descriptive statistics as well as the Kaplan-Meier estimates and the log-rank test.
